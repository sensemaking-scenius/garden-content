[Call for Submissions](https://m4co.notion.site/Call-for-submissions-on-Community-Sensemaking-32f16eaa829c41618ff0c7239ff7aee6)

Spencer [explores the term "wu wei" in the context of particpatory governence in the article](https://paragraph.xyz/@scenius-gardens/wugwei): "Wu Gwei, or Going with the Flow of Governance: Applying daoist and sociocratic principles to sensemaking and governance."

Gabriel's essay "Making Sense of Sensemaking: An overview of sensemaking both solo and community varieties" [demystifies the complexity of sensemaking](https://paragraph.xyz/@scenius-gardens/making-sense-of-sensemaking) through easily accessible mental models, and explains why it's so essential in the world today. His solution for a more meaningful future means foucsing

> _Through sensemaking, we can move towards a meaning-driven culture. A culture where shared meaning is how we find community... I think the only shot we have is to re-learn how to be in community, how to make sense with each other, and how to coordinate at a grass-roots level from the bottom up._

Kristen crafted [a social sensemaking mindmap](https://paragraph.xyz/@scenius-gardens/social-sensemaking) in her ongoing journey of emerging a community sensemaking pattern language in her piece: "Social Sensemaking: Iterating Towards a Distributed Community Pattern Language"

> _My vision is to develop a pattern language that can be used by community builders in day-to-day community operations. One specific aspect of future work I'd like to explore is the design of distributed community practices based on the intelligence contained in the pattern language. I'm keen on the language having this kind of concrete utility._

Ronen makes [the case for scientific exploration at the group level](https://paragraph.xyz/@scenius-gardens/scenius-science), compared to the traditional individual researcher archetype in his piece: "From Genius Science to Scenius Science: Why personal AI tools might not be all we need to revolutionize science"

> _A recent piece called “_[_An Epistemology for Democratic Citizen Science_](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.231100)_” makes a compelling case that sometimes the goal is the journey in science. Rather than just viewing the knowledge as the product of science (what they call “industrial science”), they make the case for re-thinking the social and cognitive processes that are generating scientific knowledge (”ecological science”). Ecological science, beyond traditional science’s role as an inquiry into the natural world, is also “an inquiry into how to best cultivate and utilise humanity’s collective intelligence”._  
>   
> _On this view, the social tools we use to communicate about science would themselves be at the core of the scientific process. Those tools would function as large scale experiments in collective intelligence (CI), informed by the latest research._

Daniel responded to the thematic prompts, [producing a sketch of community sensemaking](https://paragraph.xyz/@scenius-gardens/community-sensemaking) in his piece: "On 'Community Sensemaking': A Direct Response"

> What is Community Sensemaking?  
>   
> _Orienting attention and giving a space for juxtaposing/synthesizing multiple perspectives and kinds of niche modifications (within and across individuals) of, by, for, with, (...insert other prepositions here...), in community._
